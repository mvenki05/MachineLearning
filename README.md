The project involved basic time series analysis and forecasting using a dataset containing monthly air passenger numbers from 1949 to 1960. The data demonstrated both an upward trend and seasonal patterns.

For model development, a manual ARIMA model was trained, incorporating techniques like moving average and differencing to transform the time series into a stationary form. Additionally, an Auto ARIMA model was implemented to account for seasonality and automatically select the optimal ARIMA(p,d,q) parameters. The final prediction achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 52.1841.
